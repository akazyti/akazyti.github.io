Either you are an engineer or doctor or anything. one thing that remains the same for all is time. the more efficient you will be more you can get out of time. There are various ways to manage time by very little to manage efficiency . 3 Day is a simple hack I use to calculate my efficiency you can check my list [here](./list). there are simple steps that I use to do in order to calculate it. here are the following steps



### Step 1: Set your Golas in terms of points

Waking up at 5 AM - 10 points

Writing an algorithm - 10 points

There are two kinds of points one is static point system in which you provide specific point for specific task other is progressive point system in which you provide certain points for doing it for certiain time eg. for each hour of programming you get 10 points upto 8 hours then you get -3 for upcomming hours this will keep you more efficient. Always try to find things that are good eg. study says if you do study in early morning then it is more efficient then give more points to that. if certain task is more important to you and you want that in habbit eg. waking up at 5 am then give more points to it.

### Step 2: Tag your day and be serious about it 

Eg. Tag you sleeping time, walking time etc. 

Tagging is an art i will say i am pretty much very serious about it. when i wake up i start a tag for my chores . when i finish that i start a tag for a walk. the more accurate you are about it the more it is efficient. i know some peoples who don't know exactly how much time it takes for them to eat !!. i am also finding some way to replace it tagging system

### Step 3: Account it 

Account for your each step and accumulate it somewhare. you should have a clear report of what you are doing and for how much time. Then you can have a clear view of what you are doing wrong. you should have report of time per tag and points you have earned.



### Step 4: Improve it

Now you know what you can do from your findings.

one of the thing i found about my findings is that actually it seems that my travel time to my collage is 2 hours but effectively it is 3.5 hours then i calculated it why it is taking that much and i effectively reduced that to 2.5 hours saving me about 10 hours a week and saved me 260 hours a semister



## Make it more Enjoyable

you can add more rules to make it more effective to you here are some of my favourite things but you can use some of your hacks too..

- Keep the Negative marking

if you won't wake up at 5 AM then (-10) Points. 

- Max Cap for Certain activities

Movie should be less than 5 hours or etc.

No more than 10 backspaces per minute and there should be a throughput like x amount of work can be done in y amount of time and you should monitor it



## The good part....

you can apply this system to **time**, **money**, **helth**, **effort** or pretty much anything  in your life.
