# Context Switch

Context switch is basically a concept in Operating Systems. To achieve multitasking processors run multiple processes in time where giving a fraction of time to each process. if you have less processes the switching will be less and your CPU will not hang. if you will open more softwares it will start to hang each process will get less time to execute and nothing will come to finish

### Context switch in real life

When you work on something the biggest enemy is our own mind. it occasionally brings some new things to work upon and adds new processes in layman words thoughts to think upon more be the thoughts more will be the switches. each thought will get less time and nothing will end to finish

### How to Avoid it

A Paper and pen can save you. Everyday prepare a goal to achieve and as soon as you get a distraction thought just write it on paper this gives your mind a signal that we just delayed it for a time and will definitely think upon it. At the end of day just give it a glance that is that even worth the time or not and move forward.
