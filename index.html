        <h1>Akash Chaudhari</h1>
<p>Heya I run a Software Service company called <a href="https://zaspi.in">Zaspi!!</a> Where We work with emerging Startups that requires High Velocity Development and Shorter Time to Market. We are Team of About 10+ Peoples now who knows right meaning of bootstraping.</p>
<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>I am not a writer nor i want to so you can call me a occational writer. especially on this blog, I don't want to explain any tech or framework like react but i sometimes write about things life and different kind of people had taught me since so far. I did my first job at age 13 and since then i met thousand of peoples with 1000's of stories and experiences with me. i write on that here...</p>
<h3>Startups</h3>
<p>I did my first startup in my college in 2016 that went from proof of concept to ‚Çπ200K($3000) seed funding to our first ‚Çπ100K ($1500) customer. but then due lack of team enthusiasm and knowledge didn't make it so far. i don't think that i didn't learn anything out of it. you can find my full list <a href="./startups">here</a>.</p>
<h3>3day</h3>
<p>3day is a hack i use to analyze my time efficiency. it is a point based and tag based system i use to improve myself, not only the code but also activities in my life. you can find a full list <a href="./3day/list">here</a> i fully analyze my time efficiency it sometimes increases, sometimes i don't know ü§£Ô∏è.</p>
<h3>Checklist</h3>
<p>There are lot of things in this world i want to know about. i maintain a full list of <a href="./checklist">checklist</a> i want to explore. i know the more things you know the more deflect from specialist to generalist so i always try to keep my area of specialization low as possible but whenever i get something to read i get ü§ì.</p>
