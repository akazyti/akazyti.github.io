### Zaspi (2017)

Zaspi is a Software Service and Consulting company. As of now we are 2 Members. I did this startup back in 2017 but actually started to focus on it in 2021.

### NeatSwitch(2016 - 2019)

This is my first startup where we made Smart IOT devices for industries and offices. This was by far the most learning experience for me where was able to create team of 8 members, seed funding of ₹200K, first customer of ₹100K but due to lack of knowledge and team enthusiasm it ended in 2019
