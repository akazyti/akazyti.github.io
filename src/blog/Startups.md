# startup learnings and why they fail....


### The Window

First thing every founder should do is stop looking at world with a window.. there is no thing called passion that's why there are not a lot of rich peoples... if i say my passion is to play guitar on mars i will be dead by now... you need a far eye thinking and understanding how world works and how you can change it... founders only passion is to solve problems in world and to cash it ....

### General Questions to Ask Yourself
What is Nature of business ?

Is Business Eradicable ?

What are General Profit Margins ?

Is Sector Growing ?

How much is your competitors are growing ?

Do we have any competitive advantage ?

Are you solving any problem ?

### The Super 8 Milestones

These are 8 milestones you need to hit to make any startup successfully. It should be in sequence and if you jumped at any step you are lying to yourself only ...

1. Do you know what problem you are solving ?
2. Does your solution actually work ?
3. Does somebody pay for it ?
4. Does many people pay for it ?
5. Can non-founders sell this ?
6. Does Growth Process Scale ?
7. Can we Scale without excessive churn rate ?
8. Can we scale profitably ?

Whenever you hit a milestone your business motion and value changes.... if you solve first 4 steps your thinking and direction will change to much ....

### The Sub Phases

#### Product Market Fit
1. Test Hypothesis ("What are you solving & How")
2. Prove Value ("our solution is acceptable")
3. Prove that it can be sold ("Founder makes a sale")

Well in this step we generally keep the cash burn low and majorly founders work on this ...
#### Search for Repeatable Scalable Profitable Model
4. Find Repeatable Sales Motion ("A Pattern that can be sold to many !!")
5. Prove Non Founders can sell ("Our first Mini Sales Team")
6. Make it scalable ("Does it Actually Scale")
7. Ensure Customer Success ("Can we scale without success, if customer success will be great word of mouth, sales & marketing will follow itself")
8. Make it profitable ("Can we scale profitably")

Now here we find pattern in our offering and try to sell it to mega audience... at this step founders make a playbook for sales team that they follow to sell... founders work is very much important here ... along with that what major startups skip is customer success.. here it is necessary that we figure out two things first is what makes customer happy and other is what makes us profitable ....

#### Scaling the business
9. Hit the gas & Scale ("Now we have figured out the scalable model it's time to churn money")
10. Scale Organization & it processes
11. Expand International
12. Add additional product to line



### Mistakes

The Major are this ones
1. Startups jump the step like "without proving value we start selling to mega" or "without figuring out sales motion we hit the gas"
2. We hit the gas before achieving step 8 and we don't hit the gas after we achieve step 8
3. We don't sell to the mark
4. We are not good with people
5. We are not always closing
6. We are not good with math
7. We don't have enough persuasion 
8. Our sales people are not self independent 
9. We are not doing competitor analysis
10. We don't know KPI's
11. We are not adding enough value


##  Steps For Each Milestone

4. do you really care about this problem

#### Here you will get some feedbacks on which Major decision and results are
1. base it or home run 
2. are people ready for beta test your solution ("this is important")
3. who else to talk to 
4. what you are solving ("sometimes you find what problem you are solving and what people have is different")
5. for who you are solving ("a blurry persona of people")
6. How you will measure success ("Important")


### Step 2:  MVP ("your solution")

This is your Home Ground you have to choose how your mvp looks like your focus should be feedback not features... don't make a lot.. observe a lot...

### Step 3: Selling ("Will People pay for it")

Here our focus is not to make money but to get weather people will pay for it .... so don't do it for free... people in this world will take your shit for free....
