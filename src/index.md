I did my first job at age 13 and since then i met thousand of peoples with 1000's of stories and experiences with me. i write on that here...

### Startups

I did my first startup in my college in 2016 that went from proof of concept to â‚¹200K($3000) seed funding to our first â‚¹100K ($1500) customer. but then due lack of team enthusiasm and knowledge didn't make it so far. i don't think that i didn't learn anything out of it. you can find my full list [here](./startups).
