# Feedback Driven Product Building

A Product is Something which solves a problem. Now problem can be a general one that targets a big audience or something which solves a specific problem targeting a special need. This is a general path i have followed while making any product that i make. if the problem is general then you need to define your market that you want to target, create a niece of customer etc. ect..

## Hypothesis

We all Start with a set of hypothesis a list of things that **you** feel is a solution to the problem you are solving. I call it a hypothesis bag, each hypothesis in this bag need to be validated before we come to a conclusion or invest a heavy time or money towards it.

there are many ways to test the hypothesis but majority is 
- By Observation
- By Poll
- Through A/B

#### By Observation

Observation includes any kind of Observation. If you have product then you can setup a kind of analytics and measure your KPI's if you have not then Observing how your Persona Customers React to the problem when they face it.

#### By Poll

This seems very easy that we just ask customer and get their feedback but then you should have a very good question asking skills which now most of us lack eg. did you like it ? **yes** always

#### Through A/B

This falls in category if you already have audience and you test the product on some and then roll update to else.


## What Hypothesis Provides ?

Now most of us think that hypothesis provides a solution set that customer needs ? haha it provides the actual problem. do customer care about the problem ? will they pay for it.  if you found the problem then you again went to the step 1. Making the actual hypothesis

If you are lucky they also provide a solution set. 


### Solution Set

Now you have Solution set for problems you need to validate which kind of solution actually customer wants depending upon your target market and factors of consideration. 

Now you have Solution you need to find the proper tech possibilities of solutions that you provide to customer. i call it **tech solution set** the Tech Solution set is again a hypothesis. you need to validate that thing again. if solution set is fairly simple you are not at the stage of hypothesis check else validate your tech solution set as well

## The Solutions and it Features

The Solution is always divided into set of tasks which is called **features**.

Each Feature of Solution lies in any of three circles. Should have, Must have  and Good to have. again you are at Hypothesis Set and you make a **Weighted** Feature tree which is generally categorized into Should have, Must have and Good to have. 

## The Cycle

As you will start solving a problem you will find new ones with new challenges and hypothesis that is what evolves the product and make it something that user will never say *it's not for me*
